Every civilization has 3 characteristics: aggression (friendly, normal, aggressive), development (perfectionist, normal, expansionistic), militarism (civilized, normal, militaristic).

Combining them a civilization behavior can result in a higher or lower aggressiveness: mongols have the highest (aggressive, expansionistic, militaristic) and babylonians the lowest (friendly, perfectionist,civilized).
